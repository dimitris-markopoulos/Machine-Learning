# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning** repository! This repository is a work in progress and contains (or will contain) various machine learning projects, algorithms, and implementations, covering topics in supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and more. The goal is to provide well-documented and structured implementations of ML techniques, primarily using Python.

## 📌 Repository Overview
This repository includes (/planning adding in the future):
**Supervised Learning**: Regression, Classification, Decision Trees, SVMs, etc.
**Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, PCA, Anomaly Detection.
**Unsupervised Learning**:
  - Clustering: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN  
  - Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, t-SNE, UMAP  
  - Anomaly Detection: PYOD models (LOF, HBOS, AutoEncoders, etc.), Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM
**Deep Learning**: Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers.
**Reinforcement Learning**: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient Methods.

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For all development and documentation.
- **Google Colab**: For GPU-accelerated model training and experimentation.
- **GitHub**: For version control, collaboration, and project organization.
