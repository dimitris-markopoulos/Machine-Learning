This repository includes:
- **Supervised Learning**: Regression, Classification, Decision Trees, SVMs, etc.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, PCA, Anomaly Detection.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient Methods.
- **Financial Machine Learning**: Predictive models for financial markets.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Bayesian methods, Hypothesis Testing, and more.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, GitHub
