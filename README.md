# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the **Machine Learning** repository! This repository is a work in progress and contains (or will contain) various machine learning projects, algorithms, and implementations, covering topics in supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, and more. The goal is to provide well-documented and structured implementations of ML techniques, primarily using Python.

## ðŸ“Œ Repository Overview
This repository includes (/planning adding in the future):
- **Supervised Learning**: Regression, Classification, Decision Trees, SVMs, etc.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering, PCA, Anomaly Detection.
- **Deep Learning**: Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Q-Learning, Policy Gradient Methods.
- **Financial Machine Learning**: Predictive models for financial markets.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Bayesian methods, Hypothesis Testing, and more.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, GitHub
