# ðŸ§© Unsupervised Learning Projects

This folder contains projects focused on unsupervised machine learning techniques â€” methods that help uncover hidden patterns and structure in data without the need for labeled outcomes.

## ðŸš§ Planned Additions

Hereâ€™s what I plan to build and include over time:

- **Clustering Algorithms**  
  - K-Means (with Elbow Method & Silhouette Analysis)
  - Hierarchical Clustering (Dendrograms + Linkage strategies)
  - DBSCAN for anomaly detection and density-based clustering

- **Dimensionality Reduction**  
  - PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for visualization and compression
  - t-SNE and UMAP for high-dimensional datasets

- **Topic Modeling**  
  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for text data
  - Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

- **Anomaly Detection**  
  - Isolation Forests and One-Class SVM
  - Autoencoders for high-dimensional anomaly detection

- **Visualization Dashboards**  
  - Interactive clustering visualizations using Plotly or Streamlit

Each project will be modular, well-commented, and accompanied by a detailed Jupyter Notebook explaining the process.
